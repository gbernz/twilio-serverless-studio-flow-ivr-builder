Quickly customize a Studio Flow IVR (phone tree) via JSON or the pre-built UI. Take it a step further by utilizing the optional Studio Flow REST API v2 to push your custom flow to the Twilio Console. Navigation of the IVR includes use of keys and speech-to-text.

## Pre-requisites

### Environment variables

This project requires some environment variables to be set. To keep your tokens and secrets secure, make sure to not commit the `.env` file in git. When setting up the project with `twilio serverless:init ...` the Twilio CLI will create a `.gitignore` file that excludes `.env` from the version history.

In your `.env` file, set the following values:

| Variable      | Description                              | Required |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `PASSCODE`    | A passcode of your choice                | false - REST API only     |
| `ACCOUNT_SID` | Twilio account sid found in your console | false - REST API only     |
| `AUTH_TOKEN`  | Twilio auth token found in your console  | false - REST API only     |
